# Basketball-GM-All-Time-roster
Custom Roster for BBGM

Where did these ratings come from?
These ratings came from 2kratings.com and for the players who don't have 2k ratings I will do my best to rate them

What are these rosters?
These rosters contain the bester players from every team

Why are all the players at age 0? Why do all the players have a large contract?
The players are at age 0 so you can maximize the time you can play with them and they have large contracts so they won't leave during the offseason because they can't trade

# Basketball GM *Updated* NBA History
This BBGM League download is up to date with players who played for every single team, their acolytes, and if they are in the hall of fame

# Where are the ratings from
In order to be in this league file you need to have one roster selection and a rating from 2kratings.com meaning if you are a bad current player you have a higher chance of getting in than a bad retired player because the bad retired players won't be in the historic teams so they won't have a rating.
